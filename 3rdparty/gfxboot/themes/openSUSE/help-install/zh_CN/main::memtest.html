<a name="memtest">内存测试</a>
</h3>

<p>
The included <em>内存测试</em> provides good possibilities to
stress test the hardware of a system. Its main purpose is to detect
broken RAM, but it also stresses many other parts of the system.

<p>
There is no guarantee that the memory is good if no errors are
found, although most of memory defects will be found.
