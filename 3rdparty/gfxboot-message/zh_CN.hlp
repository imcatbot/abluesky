main引导加载程序帮助欢迎使用 openSUSE 12.2
可使用此菜单选择所需的功能。如果您在导航此帮助系统时有问题，请按 F1 以进入帮助系统的 help描述。此菜单中的主要功能有：
harddisk从硬盘引导：此选择对系统无影响。它只会启动先前安装的操作系统。
linux安装：此安装方式在大部分计算机上有效。如果在引导期间遇到系统死机或检测硬件组件时遇到问题（如磁盘控制器或网卡），则尝试使用以下安装选项之一。
noacpi安装 － 禁用 ACPI: Many of the currently-sold computers have incomplete or faulty ACPI implementations. This selection disables ACPI support in the kernel, but still enables many performance features, like DMA for IDE hard disks.
nolapic安装 － 禁用本地 APIC: If the normal installation fails, this might be due to the system hardware not supporting local APIC. If this seems to be the case, use this option to install without local APIC support.
failsafe安装 － 安全设置: If you were not successful with 安装, this selection might solve the issue.
rescue救援系统: This boot image starts a small Linux system in RAM. This is useful if the system does not start properly. After booting this system, log in as root.
firmware固件测试: Runs a BIOS test tool that validates ACPI and other parts of your BIOS.
memtest内存测试: Memory testing is useful for more than checking installation of new memory modules. It is a stress test for a big part of your computer system and may indicate hardware problems.
opt引导选项: The boot options may change the behavior of your system completely. They are settings for the kernel.
helpF1 Help: This is context sensitive. It will show different screens depending on the active element of the boot screen. There is also a description of this help system available.
keytableF2: Set language and keyboard mapping used by the boot loader.
videomodeF3 Video Mode: Here, choose between different screen resolutions while installing. If you encounter problems with the graphical installation, the 文本方式 may be a work-around for you.
install_srcF4 Installation Source: Choose the installation source.
driverupdateF6 Driver Update: For very new machines, a driver update may be needed to install the system.bits软件类型选择You have the choice to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of openSUSE 12.2.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助driverupdate驱动程序更新If you need a driver update floppy or CD-ROM, press F6. The boot loader asks you to insert the driver update medium after loading the Linux kernel.
A driver update is typically a floppy with new versions of hardware drivers or bug fixes needed during installation.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助failsafe安装 － 安全设置Select 安装 － 安全设置 if you encounter hangs while installing or irreproducible errors. This option disables DMA for IDE drives and all power management features. See also the kernel options for o_apmapm, o_acpiacpi and o_ideide.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助firmware固件测试Starts a BIOS checker that validates the ACPI tables and many other parts of your BIOS. Test results can be stored on usb disk or saved via network.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助harddisk从硬盘引导Select 引导已安装的操作系统 to start the system installed on your local hard disk. This system must be installed properly, because only the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the first hard disk is started. The device ID of the first hard disk is provided by the BIOS of the computer.
Use this if you forgot to remove the CD or DVD from your drive and want to start the computer from the hard disk.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助help使用帮助系统The boot loader online help is context sensitive. It gives information about the selected menu item or, if you are editing boot options, it tries to look up information about the option in which the cursor is positioned.

返回 main引导加载程序帮助memtest内存测试The included 内存测试 provides good possibilities to stress test the hardware of a system. Its main purpose is to detect broken RAM, but it also stresses many other parts of the system.
There is no guarantee that the memory is good if no errors are found, although most of memory defects will be found.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助noacpi安装 － 禁用 ACPICurrent hardware usually requires ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) to control the interrupt handling. ACPI completely replaces the old APM system.
Select 安装 － 禁用 ACPI if you encounter problems during boot of the kernel. Known problems with machines that have problems with ACPI are: 
  • kernel freezes when booting  • PCI Cards are not detected or initialized properly
You may also try the firmware固件测试 boot option and look at the test results of the ACPI validation.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助nolapic安装 － 禁用本地 APICNormally there are no problems with the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller). But if you seem to have some, try this option to boot without local APIC support.
Please don't confuse this with noacpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface).
返回 main引导加载程序帮助opt引导选项There are two types of boot options available. First, there are options that affect the installer. Second, there are kernel options. Some of the more common options are:
a) installer options 
  • o_install安装 -- select an installation source  • network网络选项 -- the network options  • o_vncVNC 选项 -- options for installation via VNC
b) kernel options 
  • o_splashsplash -- influence the behavior of the splash screen  • o_apmapm -- toggle power management  • o_acpiacpi -- advanced configuration and power interface  • o_ideide -- control the IDE subsystem
返回 main引导加载程序帮助o_hostipo_netmasko_gatewaynetwork安装程序选项：网络选项It is possible to configure the network interface right now. The hardware will be detected later by YaST2. The minimum set of options to configure your network card consists of host IP and netmask. For example: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10 netmask=255.255.255.0
or in a shorter form: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10/24
If you specified a o_install基于网络的安装 and do not specify both of these options, the installer tries to configure the network interface with dhcp. If you need a default gateway, specify this with the option 网关. For example: 
  • gateway=192.168.0.8
返回 opt引导选项o_acpi内核选项：acpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, acpi is switched on when a BIOS is detected that is newer than from year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI: 
  • pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • acpi=oldboot -- only the parts of ACPI that are relevant for booting remain activated  • acpi=off -- switch off ACPI completely  • acpi=force -- switch on ACPI even if your BIOS is dated before 2000
Especially on new computers, it replaces the old o_apmapm system.
返回 opt引导选项o_apm内核选项：apmAPM is one of the two power management strategies used on current computers. It is mainly used with laptops for functions like suspend to disk, but it may also be responsible for switching off the computer after power down. APM relies on a correct working BIOS. If the BIOS is broken, APM may have only limited use or even prevent the computer from working. Therefore, it may be switched off with the parameter 
  • apm=off -- switch off APM completely
Some very new computers may take more advantage from the newer o_acpiACPI.
返回 opt引导选项o_ide内核选项：ideIDE is, unlike SCSI, commonly used in most desktop workstations. To circumvent some hardware problems that occur with IDE systems, use the kernel parameter: 
  • ide=nodma -- switch off DMA for IDE drives
返回 opt引导选项o_install安装程序选项：installBy default, the local CD-ROMs are searched for the installation source. For a network install, select the 安装 option. Possible installation protocols are 
  • FTP  • NFS  • HTTP
The syntax to use is just like standard URLs. For example, if your server is found at 192.168.0.1 and you want to do an NFS-based install from the directory /install on this server, specify the source as follows: 
  • install=nfs://192.168.0.1/install
The network card will either be configured with dhcp or you must specify the parameters yourself as described in the network网络选项.
返回 opt引导选项o_splash内核选项：splashThe splash screen is the picture shown during system start-up. 
  • splash=0 -- The splash screen is switched off. This may be useful with very old monitors or if some error occurs.  • splash=verbose -- Activates splash, kernel and boot messages are still shown.  • splash=silent -- Activates splash, but no messages. Instead a progress bar is drawn.
返回 opt引导选项o_vncpasswordo_vnc安装程序选项：vncTo enable the VNC installation, specify the parameters vnc and vncpassword: 
  • vnc=1 vncpassword=example
The VNC server will be started and you may control YaST2 over any VNC client from a remote system.
返回 opt引导选项rescue救援系统The 救援系统 is a small RAM disk base system. From there, it is possible to make all kinds of changes to an installed system. Because only low-level tools are available in this system, it is intended for experts.
返回 main引导加载程序帮助videomode视频模式选择Press F3 to get the list of video modes your graphics card supports. The highest mode your monitor can display is preselected.
It is possible that your monitor cannot be detected automatically. In that case, select your preferred mode manually.
If your system has problems with the graphics card during the installation, the 文本方式 may be a usable work-around.
